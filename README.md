# About
`fvim` is a set of configurations and plug ins that I have collected over the years as a vim user.

I recently did a major long overdue upgrade, based on [this collection](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) by Amir Salihefendic, and [this blog post](http://items.sjbach.com/319/configuring-vim-right) by Stephen Bach.

# Usage
1. Clone this repo.
2. Change your `.vimrc` file to look like this:

```
# Replace <FVIM_DIR> with the directory where
# fvim is installed 
source <FVIM_DIR>/vimrc/vimrc.vim
```
